# Milestones: unit and gate checks

This file names the verification for each unit and each row. The row list and the order live in `GOAL.md`; this file does not repeat them. Commands run in `C:/_projects/SampleUser/quota-baton-impl`, one after another, in the default target with `CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0`.

## Unit check (closes a unit)

- The focused tests covering the change: `cargo test -p <crate> <filter>`. Use the test names that the unit added or touched.
- `cargo clippy -p <touched crate> --all-targets -- -D warnings`
- UI units: the live harness captures for the states the unit changed.

## Gate check (closes a row)

1. `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
3. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features --all-targets -- -D warnings`
4. `cargo test --workspace --no-fail-fast`
5. `cargo test --workspace --all-features --no-fail-fast`
6. `cargo test -p qb-core --no-fail-fast`
7. `cargo build -p quota-baton`
8. **Launch or wiring changes only:** run `target/debug/quota-baton.exe launch-client --check` against the real `%LOCALAPPDATA%\quota-baton` journal, read-only, and record the result.
9. **Independent review**, where the brief asks for one: a different model family from the implementer.

## Fingerprint and reuse

- Record each check once: the commit, the command, the exit code, the scope and the totals. Put this in `.sandbox/reports/<M>-evidence/` and link it from the report.
- A result is reused while its fingerprint is unchanged. The design session reuses the gate for the same commit and re-runs only a merge result that differs.

## Completion

The goal stays open while any row in `GOAL.md` is open. Before marking it complete, compare the open rows there with this file. Completion follows the design session's gate judgment, and a row that needs installation closes when the design session has installed and verified it.
